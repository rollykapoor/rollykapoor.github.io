	We measure the benefit to society created by preventing COVID-19 deaths through a marginal increase in early social distancing. We exploit county-level rainfall on the last weekend before statewide lockdown in the early phase of the pandemic. After controlling for historical rainfall, temperature, and state fixed-effects, current rainfall is a plausibly exogenous instrument for social distancing. A one percent decrease in the population leaving home on the weekend before lockdown creates an average of 132 dollars of benefit per county resident within 2 weeks. The impacts of earlier distancing compound over time and mainly arise from lowering the risk of a major outbreak, yielding large but unevenly distributed social benefit.

Pilot Completed

This paper studies whether enabling women to commute to work with other women (“travel buddies”) from their neighborhoods increases their employment. Data and anecdotal evidence suggest that social norms and safety concerns make it impossible for many women to travel alone outside the immediate vicinity of their residence. As part of the pilot study, I conducted a small-scale RCT in partnership with with an apparel factory in India that predominantly employs women. Women in the treatment branch (travel buddy group) were invited in groups to travel to the worksite to participate in walk-ins, while women in the control group were invited individually via door-to-door visits. I also incentivized women to participate in walk-ins by offering two types of one-time travel subsidies. In the first group, I offered to cover the round trip cost to the factory site for the women on the day of the interview. In the second group, I additionally offered to cover the cost of their adult accompaniment (if any). The pilot produces three key findings. Firstly, for the women in the study sample, the show-up rate was 18% (34 of the 184 women showed up at the factory location to participate in the walk-in interviews). This rate is quite encouraging compared to the take-up rates of existing expensive interventions targeted toward women's labor force participation and training programs. . Secondly, regardless of the treatment status, 88% of all women who showed up at the factory did not travel alone. These findings are consistent with my hypothesis that women cannot travel alone. And finally, approximately three times more women from the travel buddy group showed up for interviews than the control group. The control group's mean was 0.09 (9% show-up rate), whereas the mean for the travel buddy group was 0.26 (26% show-up rate). That's equivalent to a 170% increase over the control group. The show-up rates for women in the two subsidy groups were 18% and 20%, respectively.
