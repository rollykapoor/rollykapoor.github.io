I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

My primary fields of interest are Development Economics, Labor Economics, and Applied Microeconomics. I study topics related to gender, access and physical mobility, primarily in developing countries. 


 
 For my [job market paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5113413), I investigate how coordinated travel among job-seeking women in India can improve their job search outcomes and employment.
