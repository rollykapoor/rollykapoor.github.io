I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

My primary fields of interest are Development Economics, Labor Economics, and Applied Microeconomics. I study topics related to gender, access and physical mobility, primarily in developing countries. 


**I am on the 2024-25 Economics Job Market.**
 
 For my [job market paper](/files/Rolly_Kapoor_JMP.pdf), I investigate how coordinated travel among job-seeking women in India can improve their job search outcomes and employment.
